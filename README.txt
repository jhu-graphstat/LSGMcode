This folder contains the Large Seeded Graph Matching (LSGM) algorithm coded in Matlab to perform divide--and--conquor graph matching for large graphs.

Here is an description of what is in the folder:
Main Matlab function files:
1. BigGMr_hardcoded.m: the main function to perform LSGM on two graphs.
2. test_run.m : an example of how to use the LSGM function to record accuracy and run time on real data.
Run test_run.m to see a demo of LSGM.

Extra file: 
1. KKI-08-29.mat: the data file used to run test_run.m
